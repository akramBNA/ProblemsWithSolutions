Hello everyone welcome to my ProblemsWithSolutions repository!

In this repo I try to solve some toy problems found on the internet.
You will find the problem description first on the top of the page and the solution will be below it.

If anyone has a better approach for the solution (optimized time complexity) you can submit your contribution.
Fork this repo, write your code and push it! Don't forget to send me a pull request.

Enjoy.
